If you're one of the approximately 8 people who regularly visit this site a month (_if I am to believe Google Analytics_)...

... Firstly, thank you for your interest in this small corner of the Internet!

Secondly, you may have noticed that I haven't published an article here in a while. The reason for this is that I have been flung far from my workshop and all of my beloved tools for the last year and a half ðŸ˜¢.

As you may know, my day job at the time of writing is as an Embedded Electronics Engineer at Dyson. For the past few years I've mostly worked in the research function, working on prototyping electronics and sensing tech for our new product concepts. In 2024 I got the very fortunate opportunity to go out to South East Asia and work in the new research branch in Dyson's Singapore office. Through a series of unexpected events, my original six month placement in Singapore turned into a seventeen month saga that involved me moving to Malaysia and transitioning to a role that took me all the way to the production line of our products!

In this article I'll go over some of the key highlights of the year and some of the interesting takeaways from my experience out in South East Asia. Note that due to the confidential nature of the work, most of the images on this page will just be pictures of industrial estates or holiday snaps!

This is a departure from my usual style of content on this website, which is mostly made up of multiple images interspersed with technical jargon. Hopefully this piece doesn't come across too much like a travel column or a LinkedIn post!

I hope you found this mild ramble somewhat interesting, and rest assured that I have some exciting projects planned for the rest of 2025!
