Naturally there are parts of our manufacturing supply chains that are very strictly controlled by review processes. Actions such as motor geometry changes or Battery Management System software releases have very lengthy approval processes, as changes here can have significant safety consequences.",Ye,D,ii=`However, in many other parts
of development I was frankly shocked at how easy it was to get certain changes pushed through. I assumed that something like a change to a tester station spec on our main production line would need to go through countless layers of bureaucracy to get rolled out. In actuality, often these changes could be implemented the same day simply by chatting to one engineer and sending off an email to one of our test vendors! This ability to get things done in such a short timeframe was actually quite gratifying!`,Xe,N,ni="The dark side of this is that other people also take advantage of this ability to move quickly, and suddenly you find yourself in a situation where major modifications to part tooling has been done mere weeks before start of production and no-one has thought to tell you about it‚Ä¶",Qe,F,oi="This combination of fast pace and last minute changes does mean that often we need to make compromises when it comes to balancing a perfected design vs. delivering on time.

Taking just this single Contract Manufacturer (<a href="https://flex.com/" rel="nofollow">Flex Ltd.</a>) as case study, the scale of the operation is remarkable. Not only do the facilities have an impressive level of automation and good observability of their tooling &amp; assembly lines, but the tight-knit nature of their supply chains explain why they can develop so quickly and cheaply.',at,V,st,Z,hi="In Dyson, especially in research, we have a tendency to try and own every part of our product assemblies. Everything from motor control software to tooling design is done in-house. This does have some advantages: we can often optimise a product to be at the very limit of performance that we can achieve in a consumer-grade product. The <em>trade-off</em> is that we often take longer to develop products, as we have to gain the relevant expertise across all new disciplines.",lt,R,pi="The Contract Manufacturers in China seem to operate very differently. They have a huge network of different suppliers in close proximity, so they can subcontract out large portions of the work to other manufacturers who have that specific domain expertise.

While even in Malaysia the work pace is faster than what I experienced in the UK, it paled in comparison to the attitudes of the teams in Zhuhai.

Ultimately I think that many people in the west have a stigma towards Chinese manufacturing that doesn‚Äôt reflect the immense skill and work ethic that has driven its success.
