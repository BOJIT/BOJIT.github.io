This makes it quite inconvenient to deploy them across a wide area.

To stream the data, I intended to use the low-bandwidth <a href="https://ndi.video/type/ndi-tools/" rel="nofollow">NDI Protocol</a>. This is a lossy video compression scheme, but it’s very low-latency on a local network and plenty sufficient for the low-resolution images that the kinect outputs.',A,v,mt="For this project, the ideal candiate at the time was a <em>Rock64</em> SBC.
